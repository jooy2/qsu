# Installation for Dart <Badge type="info" text="Dart" />

There are a few simple steps to install **qsu** in Dart.

You need to have at least `Dart 3.x` to install **qsu**.

If you are using Flutter, you need to be using at least Flutter version `3.10.x`. In this case, you don't need to worry about the Dart version because it is determined by Flutter.

For safety and high compatibility, it is recommended to keep the Dart and Flutter versions as up-to-date as possible.

After configuring the Dart environment, run the following command to install the library:

### Dart-only

```bash
$ dart pub add qsu
```

### Flutter

```bash
$ flutter pub add qsu
```

## How to use

Import the `package:qsu/qsu.dart` file at the top of the file you want to use.

```dart
import 'package:qsu/qsu.dart';
```

To learn more about the functions supported, refer to the [Reference](/reference/index.md) documentation.

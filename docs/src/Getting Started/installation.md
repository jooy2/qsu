# Installation

Qsu requires `Node.js 18.x` or higher, and the repository is serviced through **[NPM](https://npmjs.com)**.

Qsu is **ESM-only**. You must use `import` instead of `require` to load the module. There are workarounds available for CommonJS, but we recommend using ESM based on recent JavaScript trends.

After configuring the node environment, you can simply run the following command.

```bash
# via npm
$ npm install qsu

# via yarn
$ yarn add qsu

# via pnpm
$ pnpm install qsu
```
